        unwanted or unexpected event
        occurs during compile tme or runtime
        compile time exceptions:checked exceptions
        runtime exceptions:unchecked exceptions

        to prevent them, we must write code that detects and handles them

        before handling, you gotta know what type of exception is

        UNCHECKED EXCEPTIONS
        -they occur during runtime
        -code will compile even if we do not handle them
        -they have IS A relationship with RuntimeException (parent class)
        -they are hard to detect as the code will run anyway
        -if you dont handle them, they can crash your program


        CHECKED EXCEPTIONS
        -the kind of exceptions that are checked at the compile time
        -they dont have any relatiosnhip with RuntimeException class
        -occurs during compile time
        -code will not compile and run
