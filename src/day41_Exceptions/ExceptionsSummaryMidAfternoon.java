        Exceptions - unwanted or unexpected events
        -unchecked - unexpected event - occurs during runtime - can still compile - RuntimeExceptions
        -checked - unwanted event - occurs during compile time - can not compile - not RuntimeExceptions

        for checked class, compiler class will tell you which class to use to handle
        for unchecked class, sometimes compiler will not tell you which class to use

        try & catch blocks: used for handling checked and unchecked exceptions

        exceptions are fake bugs. there is a difference between fixing a bug and handling an exception
        fixing the bugs is the job of the developers, not testers
        testers are responsible for finding the bugs
        if you use printStackTrace for instance, it is gonna be easier for devs to find the bug behind that exception to fix it

        try{
        exception code
        }catch (ExceptionClass e){
        e.printStackTrace();
        }

        catch block is responsible to catch the exception object created after the occurance of the exception
