        it is a template,  a blueprint of a class
        (as in, classes are blueprints of objects. interface in this case is a blueprint of a class)
        interface keyword is used to create interface
        it specifies the behavior(s) that a class should implement
        provides additional methods that subclasses need
        we can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces
        we use implements keyword just we use extends keyword during class creation

        Bird extends Animal implements Flyable, Playable

        can not be instantiated
        multiple inheritance is allowed
        cann not have constructor
        can have static, abstract and default methods
        can have static variables only and they are final by default
        interface itself can not be final
        can not use other access modifiers than public

        ex:
        public interface Flyable{
        public void abstract fly();
        }
         */







    }
