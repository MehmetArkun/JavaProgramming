        abstraction
            -focusing on essentials, not worrying about the details, implementation.
            -focusing on what it is
            -abstract method: method without implementation and body
            -abstract method is meant to be overridden in child class
            -number of overriding depends on number of sub-classes
            -when overriding, we are only creating that method for only once
            -by overridign we are using the same with different implementation
            -you can not override every method
            -2 ways to achieve the abstraction:
                    -abstract class
                    -interface
            -Abstract class: meant to be super class (parent)
                             can not be final
                             can not have object becuse it is not concrete
                             can have all the methods, variables, blocks of non-abstract class

            -can not be instantiated
            -multiple inheritance is not allowed
            -can have constructor
            -can have instance, static, and abstract methods
            -can have instance and static variables
            -can not be final
            -can use other access modifiers than public
