        process of hiding implementation details from the user
        only the functionality will be provided to the user
        focusing on the essential qualities of something rather than one specific example.
        (ignoring  irreveland & unimportant)
        user will have the info on what object does instead of how it does
        implementation will be child's class
        parent's class responsibility will be the functionality
        parent class needs to be abstract
        method in parent class needs to be without body
        if tehre is no body, there will be no implementation
        parent class is not the class where we should carry about the small details
        abstract method is the method without body and there should be abstract keyword in method signature
        it is meant to be overridden
        abstract method can not be static, final, and can not be with private access modifier
        abstract method can only be created in abstract class or in an interface
        abstract class is supposed to be parent
        goal is to provide reuusable variables and methods to sub clases
        abstract class can not be instantiated
